# interface
Interface is a library for Python that can help you use Tkinter and create good quality programs.

### How to use
We recommend you to use Visual Studio Code for coding.
Just copy the code inside the interface.py and paste it into your own interface.py inside your Python program. Then you will be able to import it into your main Python program to use it as library.

### Recommendations by the creator
I recommend you placing the interface.py inside a folder named "libs", so you can simple import it by "import libs.interface as interface".
